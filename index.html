            <p><pre> Love is the first light that breaks the dawn,
            A whisper soft, a sigh, a yawn.
            It stirs the soul from silent sleep,
            Awakens depths so vast, so deep.
            A glance, a touch- a spark takes flight,
            A rush of warmth, a burst of light.
            It comes unasked, it comes unbidden,
            Like flowers bloom by springtime hidden.</pre></p>

            <!-- [All your poem sections would go here...] -->

            <h2>Coda: The Last Verse</h2>
            <p><pre>If all the poets since the birth,
            Of time could scour the earth,
            They'd never cage in ink or art,
            This wildfire burning in my heart.
            So let the scholars strain to see- 
            Love's algebra is you and me.
            No formula, no chart, no creed,
            Just flesh and soul and want and need.
            Now every sunset wears your name,
            Each breeze repeats it just the same.
            And when I sleep, the cosmos parts,
            To show me you- my sky, my stars.</pre></p>

            </div>

            <p><pre>If love were a language, you'd be its poet- 
            Turning whispers into wildfires,
            And heartbeats into hymns.
            May our own love story be written in starlight,
            And may you always find the words when the heart runs deep.
            Keep blooming in the garden of tenderness, and remember:
            The best love poems aren't penned- they are lived!</pre></p>

    <h2>Love story untold</h2>
    6B77-41A0
 
    
    <p> <pre> Love is the first light that breaks the dawn,nnnn
        A whisper soft, a sigh, a yawn.
        It stirs the soul from silent sleep,
        Awakens depths so vast, so deep.
        A glance, a touch- a spark takes flight,
        A rush of warmth, a burst of light.
        It comes unasked, it comes unbidden,
        Like flowers bloom by springtime hidden.
    </pre>
    </p>
    <p> <pre> Love is surrender, wild and free
        A storm that shakes the earth and and sea 
        It bends the will, it breaks the pride,
        Yet lifts the heart on golden tide.
        To love is both to lose and gain,
        To dance in joy, to bear the pain.
        It asks for all- yet gives much more,
        A key that opens every door.
    </pre>
    </p>
    <p> <pre>Love is a flame that burns so bright,
        It  turns the darkest day to light.
        A touch like embers, fierce and sweet,
        A pulse that echoes, strong and fleet.
        It warms the bones of lonely nights,
        It fills the soul with pure delights.
        Yet fire can scar, can sear, can ache- 
        For love will wound, for love's own sake.
    </pre> 
    </p>
    <p> <pre> Love is the thunder, love is the rain,
        The howling wind, the sharpest pain.
        It tears the heart, it bends the spine,
        Yet in it's wreck, new stars will shine.
        For storms will pass, and skies will clear,
        And love remains through every fear.
    </pre> 
    </p>
    <p><pre>  Love is the seed, the soil, the sun,
        A work that's never fully done.
        With patient hands, we tend, we sow,
        And watch the tender blossoms grow.
        It asks for time, for care, grace,
        For gentle touch and warm embrace.
        Each day it blooms in different hues,
        In laughter shared and silent truths.</pre>

    </p>
    <p> <pre>Love is the harbor, love the shore,
        The constant knock on heaven's door.
        When waves are high and winds are wild,
        Love stays steady, love stays mild.
        It holds the heart when all seems lost,
        It pays no mind no time or cost.
        A queit strenght, a bond so true,
        A shelter built for me.</pre>
    </p>
    <p><pre>Love is the glass that shows the soul,
        The hand that heals, the hand that holds.
        It strips the masks we wear so well,
        Reveals the truth no tongue can tell.
        In love's pure light, we stand exposed,
        With all our flaws, with all our ghosts.
        Yet still, it whispers, soft and kind,
        You are enough- you are divine.</pre>
    </p>
    <p><pre>Love is the rhythm, love the song,
        The steps we learn our whole life long.
        A turn, a pause, a leap, a fall,
        Yet love will catch us through it all.
        It sways in time with joy and pain,
        A melody that won't explain.
        It leads, it follows, spins, it sways,
        A dance that lasts through all our days.</pre>

    </p>
    <p><pre>Love is the echo through the years,
        The laughter mixed with falling tears.
        It outlives flesh, it outlives bone,
        A light that lingers when we are gone.
        For love remains when all else fades,
        In whispered words in twilight shades.
        It writes its name on every heart- 
        A masterpiece, a work of art.</pre>
    </p>
    <h2><pre>Epilogue:A Thousand Words, Yet Never Enough</h2>
    <p><pre>If i could speak in tongues of gold,
        If all the poet's ink were told,
        Still love would slip past every line- 
        A force too vast to define.
        So take these words, but seek the more,
        For love's true name is to explore,
        Not in verse, but in the beat,
        Of hearts that love makes whole, complete.</pre></p>
    </p>
    <h1>A Symphony of Fire and Stars</h1>
    <p><pre>It began with a glance- a lightning thread,
        A silent word the heart has said.
        The world dissolves to just one face,
        A touch like dawn, a breath of grace.
        Your voice, a melody half-known,
        A song my soul has always owned.
        The air between us hums, alive,
        A golden thread no hand could weave.</pre>
    </p>
    <p><pre>I fall into you like rain to earth,
        Like rivers finding home at last.
        Your hands, the shore where i am known,
        Your lips, the fire that melts my stone.
        To love you is to lose my name,
        To be reborn in golden flame.
        No king, no saint, no ghost, no sage- 
        Just flesh and breath and whispered praise.</pre></p>
        <p><pre>Your love is embers on my skin,
            A slow, sweet burn i drown within.
            The arch of midnight, bare and bright,
            Our bodies writing poems in light.
            Oh, trace the stars along my spine,
            Let every scar and curve be thine.
            The sheets are hymns, the bed a shrine- 
            I worship where your breath meets mine.</pre>
        </p>
        <p><pre>Our love has grown like jasmine in the dark,
            A fragile bloom, a fleeting spark.
            We have tended it well, and watched it rise- 
            A vine that climbs beyond the skies.
            Your laughter, sunlight through the leaves,
            Your patience, roots that hold the seams.
            Each day we plant, we weed, we sow,
            And from our care, the blossoms grow.</pre>
        </p>
        <p><pre>When all the world is shifting sand,
            You are the compass in my hands.
            The North my heart remembers well,
            The harbor where the storm rebels.
            No wave could drag me from your side,
            No wind could steal this peace inside.
            For home is not a place- it's this:
            Your forehead pressed to mine, a kiss.</pre>
        </p>
        <p><pre>In you, i see the best i am,
            The man i was before the dam.
            Of time and doubt and fear was built-
            The boy who loved without the guilt.
            You strip the masks i've worn for years,
            You kiss away the unshed tears.
            And in your eyes, i'm new, i'm true- 
            Not what i've done, but what i'll do.</pre> 
        </p>
        <p><pre>To love is not to own, buy free,
            To lose the hawk and watch it gleam.
            I'd carve my heart to see you soar,
            And count the bleeding worth the war.
            Yet in your flight, you circlr near,
            Your wings, my shelter, sharp and clear.
            For love that binds us sets aflame,
            Is love that crowns, not love that chains.</pre>
        </p>
        <p><pre>We move like tides, like moon and sea,
            A push, a pull, a harmony.
            No need for steps or rigid art- 
            The music's written in our hearts.
            Sometimes we lead, sometimes we bend,
            But alwasys, always, meet again.
            Two souls, one rhythm, fierce and sweet,
            A dance that makes the stars retreat.</pre>
        </p>
        <p><pre>When time has turned our bones to dust,
            And silence claims the vows we've thrust.
            Into the wind- our love will stay,
            A ghost of light, a breath of clay.
            For love like ours is never gone,
            It sings in rivers, hums in dawn.
            The universe will lean and pause,
            To hear our echo in it's laws.</pre>

        <h2>Coda:The Last Verse</h2>
        <p><pre>If all the poets since the birth,
            Of time could scour the earth,
            They'd never cage in ink or art,
            This wildlife burning in my heart.
            So let the scholars strain to see- 
            Love's algebra is you and me.
            No formula, no chart, no creed,
            Just flesh and soul and want and need.
            Now every sunset wears your name,
            Each breeze repeats it just the same.
            And when i sleep, the cosmos parts,
            To show me you- my sky, my stars.</pre>
        </p>
        <p><pre>If love were a language, you'd be its poet- 
            Turning whispers into wildfires,
            And heartbeats into hymns.
            May our own love story be written in starlight,
            And may you always find the words when the heart runs deep.
            Keep blooming in the garden of tenderness, and remember:
            The best love poems aren't penned- they are lived!</pre>
            
            <pre>With warmth,
            The muse, mark henry
            Your everyday crush.</pre>
